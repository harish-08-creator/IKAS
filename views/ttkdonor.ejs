                <h3><b>Things to Know for Kidney Donors</b></h3><br><br>
	<p>Donating a kidney is a generous act that can save lives and improve health outcomes for those in need of a transplant. However, it is important for potential donors to have a clear understanding of what is involved in the process. Here are some things to know if you are considering becoming a kidney donor:</p><br>
	
	<h5><b>The Evaluation Process</b></h5><br>
	<p>Potential donors will undergo a series of tests and evaluations to determine if they are a suitable candidate for kidney donation. This process typically includes:</p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>A medical history review</li>
		<li>A physical exam</li>
		<li>Blood tests</li>
		<li>Urine tests</li>
		<li>Imaging tests</li>
		<li>Possible additional testing as needed</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>It is important to understand that not all potential donors will be deemed eligible for donation, even if they are willing to undergo the evaluation process.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h5><b>Risks and Benefits</b></h5><br>
	<p>Like any surgery, kidney donation carries some risks. These can include:</p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Pain</li>
		<li>Bleeding</li>
		<li>Infection</li>
		<li>Reaction to anesthesia</li>
		<li>Long-term kidney function problems</li>
	</ul><br><br.
	<p>However, for most donors, the benefits of kidney donation outweigh the risks. These can include:</p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Improvement in the recipient's health and quality of life</li>
		<li>The satisfaction of knowing you have helped someone in need</li>
		<li>The ability to donate to a loved one or friend</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	<h5><b>Post Kidney transplantation function</b></h5>
	<p>The most important question donors ask is how donation will impact their health. We know that kidney donors have a 25-35% permanent loss of kidney function at donation. The loss of function is not 50% because the remaining kidney increases in size and does some additional work to make up for the donated kidney. Kidney donors do not have a higher risk of developing end stage kidney disease than other members of the population with the same profile (same  age, sex, and race).
    When chronic kidney disease develops, it usually shows in mid-life (40-50years old). End stage kidney disease generally develops after age 60. Treatment for end stage kidney disease requires dialysis or transplantation. If a donor is young, it is difficult to predict whether they will develop kidney disease in their lifetime. If a donor were to develop end stage kidney disease, having one kidney would not change the risk, but that person may progress to end stage sooner with one kidney. Donors are at higher risk for kidney disease if they have some kind of damage to the remaining kidney such as a tumor or trauma. 
    If a living donor was to need a transplant later in life, current national practice is to give them priority in the transplant system.</p><br><br>
    <h5><b>Follow up care</b></h5><br>
    <p>After discharge, donors may continue to have some abdominal pain for approximately one to two weeks, but each person may have a different pain experience. Donors must not lift over 20 pounds for six weeks after donation. Full recovery from the surgery takes approximately six weeks.
      Donors are seen in the clinic by the transplant surgeon and the ILDA one week after discharge from the hospital. Donors should feel free to call the Transplant Center at any time to talk to the living donor nurse coordinator if any problems develop. Each donor will be contacted by the IDA at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after donation to ask questions about the donor's health. Labwork will be done at these intervals at no cost to the donor. This information will be reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Any infection or cancer that is discovered within two years of donation may need to be reported to the recipient transplant center, to local, state or federal authorities (as required) and to UNOS.
      Living donors must avoid long-term use of a class of drugs called NSAIDS. The most common NSAlDs are Motrin, ibuprofen, Aleve, naproxen, Indocin. These drugs can cause kidney damage over time. They can safely be taken for an injury for a period of two weeks but should not be taken long-term for treatment of problems such as arthritis.
      Donors should always receive routine medical care and any treating doctor should know that one kidney has been removed. The transplant team recommends:<br>
      <ul>
      <li>Yearly laboratory studies with urinalysis and blood test called creatinine</li>
      <li>A yearly physical exam with height, weight, and blood pressure measurement</li>
      <li>That donors maintain a normal weight and exercise at least 4 times a week for 30 minutes</li>
      <li>That donors eat a balanced diet avoiding saturated and trans fats and avoid excessive</li>
      <li>That donors talk to a doctor before taking any over the counter medications or supplements for more than a few weeks.</li>
      <li>That donors avoid extreme high impact sports such as cage fighting or kick boxing.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
	<br><br>
	<p>If you are interested in becoming a kidney donor, the first step is to contact a transplant center or hospital in your area to learn more about the process and eligibility requirements. While donating a kidney is a serious decision, it can also be a life-changing and rewarding experience for both the donor and recipient.</p>
